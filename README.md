Responsive Project Landing Page
==========

:question: A responsive project landing page built upon [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) which I have handcrafted for one of my projects [Markdownify](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/electron-markdownify).

:bulb: Perfect for the Open Source projects which can be described within a single page with a nice screenshot. Such as [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and as it is built upon Bootstrap, it can be customizable pretty easily according to your liking.

:computer: Take a look at the [demo](http://www.amitmerchant.com/responsive-project-landing-page/).

:fork_and_knife: Fork it and play with it! :blush:
